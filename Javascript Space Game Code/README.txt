DIV BLASTER v1.0
----------------

This code is a simple 'asteroid blaster' game. It has the
following functionality:
- 2D ship movement
- "Fire-able rockets" that can destroy asteroids they collide with
- Asteroids that can be "spawned" based on user input, and fall vertically
- Score tracking
 -- Single-session scoring (clears on refresh)
 -- Score per asteroid is inversely proportional to size (smaller==harder==more points)


========  CONTROLS  ========

Arrow-Keys: move ship
Spacebar: fire rocket
Shift: spawn one additional asteroid
