Hi there, prospective employers!

I've created this Git Repo as a way to showcase some of the code that I had written while at
at the University of Michigan. As a student, I had the opportunity to contribute to some very 
interesting projects within several different disciplines. 

In the year since college, I actively worked within other fields that brought joy,
offered personal growth, and provided real-world experience. However, it is time to
return to software. 

Unfortunately, during my final year at college, I had an accident with my previous computer that
saw me lose much of the code saved on that device. This repo is a collection of the code that I was 
recently able to salvage. The good news is that what remains is interesting and gives a good 
representation of where my skills lie. 

With that in mind, here is a short guide to what lies within. 
[Each individual project also has a smaller ReadMe in order to guide you through it's use.]

-------"Tread Lightly" Unity Game-------
This folder contains what amounts to the most impressive project in my collection. This was
created for one of my "capstone projects" [I had the luxury of doing two. Unfortunately, the 
second wasn't able to be recovered]. 

This was created with a team of 4 individuals, including myself, using the Unity game engine.
Coded in C#, this is a 3D horror game made to play for about 5 to 10 minutes. All of the assets, 
game development ideas, and programming, came from us personally.

--------Artificial Intelligence Class Code--------
This folder contains the four projects that composed my senior artificial intelligence class. 
All code was written in C++ by me personally. The specifications of each project and their 
intended use is listed in each project's readme. Two of the projects were designed to be 
interrelated and interdependent. 

--------Javascript Game Code------------
This code was created for a senior User-Interface design class. Coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, 
this is a fun game playable on web browser. Intructions for its use are inside the ReadMe. 

----------------------------------------

I hope this code is interesting and clear in regards to my involvement!
Have a great day.
Sam
