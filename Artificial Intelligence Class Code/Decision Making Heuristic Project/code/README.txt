Yes, you are running the same two lines twice. I'm not sure why, but it compiles on CAEN when you run it twice.
I would have fixed this earlier but I'm running late because I spilled coffee on my macbook! (I told Jule about this in an email).

Nonetheless, just make sure you run that FULL script seen above, it all should work from then on.


Once the project has been compiled, run the code as specified in the Assignment Document. 
However, the executable is called 'Project4'.

Example Command line run:

./Project4
