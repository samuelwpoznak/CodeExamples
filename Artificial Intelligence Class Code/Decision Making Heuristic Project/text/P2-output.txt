My rewards from the first runthrough were incredibly paltry because my agent fell into the [-1] square within a few moves.
Therefore, I got a -1.04 in my first run. 

The means and standard deviations are:

0.41024+/-0.571847
0.4128+/-0.555205
0.256+/-0.687069

listed from most runs to lowest runs. The higher runs come incredibly close to the .388 expected utility of the square.
Certainly within the std. dev.
