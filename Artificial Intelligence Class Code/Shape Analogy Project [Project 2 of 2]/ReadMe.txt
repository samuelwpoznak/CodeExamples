Hi again!

This project is a continuation of the "Shape Identification Project".

Written entirely in C++, again, this project utilized the code from the first and created 
an AI that could solve what is called "Geometric Analogy Problems."

For extensive background information about these types problems, 
this is a good resource:

---------

This project was designed to read from a file that represented basic geometric anaolgy problems,
and choose what it believed to be the correct answer. 

The "a2-poznak.pdf" file contains documentation of the code written and the methods used to solve the 
problem.

As a side note, this was one of the most fun problems that I worked on while at University.
