Hi again!

This one is fairly self-explanatory, however, the code for this project couldn't be salvaged.
As a result, I hope the actual app itself impresses.

The app can be run on either Mac or Windows and is fairly simple to run. Just double click on the
.app file or the .exe file and you should be all set.

The game itself is designed to run for about 5 to 10 minutes. It starts off with a brief tutorial
that explains the basic concepts and leads into the actual gameplay nicely. 

However, it is quicker to read:

This game places you, the protagonist in a "psychological experiment". Once you enter the experiment, 
by finishing the tutorial, you are instructed to turn on several generators in order to operate the
exit elevator. You do this by collecting light orbs, and shooting them at the generators until they 
turn on. However, you are in a horror-maze scenario, and if you get touched by an AI monster, you die!

Luckily, the monsters become frozen when hit by the same orbs mentioned above.

We've also included several jump skares that are designed to confuse and overwhelm. 

Controls:
W- walk forward
S- walk backward
A- walk left
D- walk right

F- turn on flashlight
Right Click- absorb light orbs
Left Click- shoot light orbs

Have fun!
